docker compose:
--profile - deployment environment
it's weakness is resources, docker swarm can fix that

docker alternatives:
podman, cri-o

cni - container network interface
cri - container runtime interface
protobuf - communication protocol

k8s
===========
kublet - read...
howtoforge - tutorials for k8s (k3s is rancher)


k3s
======================
install k3s.io

sometimes you need to do "sudo systemctl daemo-reload" after changing services
kubectl get nodes
(if it doesn't work)export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml


kubectl get pods -A (returns list of pods)
kubectl get pods
kubectl get nodes -o wide
kubectl get nodes -o yaml
kubectl describe nodes 
kubectl get pods -A -o wide
kubectl create deployment --image=nginx test-nginx
kubectl create deployment --image=nginx test-nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml
kubectl get deployments
kubectl describe pod
kubectl explain

expose service:
kubectl expose deployment test-nginx --type="NodePort" --port 80

kubectl get endpoints - check if service is assigned to a pod.




k8s resources:
pod->smallest resource that can run\manage a container.

k8s service


June28:
vagrant - vagrantup.com, work with local\remote virtual machines (not a must, we worked without it)

connecting one machine to the other:
using SSH:
from physical image to virtual
run ssh on the machine you need
get apt openssh....
kubeadm
kubectl
kubelet

kubectl from k3s is not the full kubectl! that's why you need to download full kubectl

commands:
kubeadm init (look at the link in telegram for control plane...)

when init is done, on the server you do "join" with the hash you recieved, the "join" command is generated at the end of the "kubeadm init"


kubeadm join 10.0.2.15:6443 --token lm4yeq.ir9b24mm5lovkjmi \
	--discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:17c989ad3efb4aa9a109212ae28f5eec09e3572f49c03cebcc94815f4186d7ce 


systmclt stop k3s
better: systemctl disable --now k3s

kubectl get nodes
